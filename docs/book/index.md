> Both the laminas-console and the [laminas-mvc-console](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mvc-console/)
> components will likely not be maintained long-term, as there are more complete

> [symfony/console](https://github.com/symfony/console).

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require laminas/laminas-console
